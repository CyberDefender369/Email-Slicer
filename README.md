# Email Slicer


## Description
This Python program extracts the username and domain from an email address. It utilizes string indexing, print formatting, user input, and the strip() and lower() methods to present the results clearly.


## Language and Utilities Used
- Python 3.10.11
- Thonny 4.1.3

## Environments Used 
- Windows 11

## Notes
The strip() method removes leading or trailing whitespace. The lower() method normalizes user input. This program does not validate input or handle exceptions; these will be covered in more advanced programs.
